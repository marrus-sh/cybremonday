				In the tiny corner of cybrespace known as <a rel="external noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse" title="Fediverse | Wikipedia"><i class="MENTION">the fediverse</i></a>, <time datetime="2018-01">January</time> and <time datetime="2018-02">February 2018</time> was a magical time.
				<strong><time>2017</time> had been a year of painful growth</strong> in a lot of ways, and with the new year folks were looking to <strong>transform what they had learned</strong> into something good the rest of the world could use.
				Questions of how to connect precariöus queer folks with <strong>financal support</strong>, <strong>material resources</strong>, and even <strong>housing</strong> were discussed regularly among friends and in the timelines; technologies like <u class="GENERAL">ActivityPub</u> were new and fresh and folks were just starting to <strong>explore what it was possible to do</strong>.
				It was out of this climate that <cite class="MONOGRAPH">The CYBRE Manifesto</cite> was born, penned by myself but drawing upon the various undercurrents that I had detected in those conversations.
			</p>
			<p>
				If the months which followed proved anything, though, it was that <strong>mere passion and inspiration are not enough</strong> to make a difference; eventually, you have to be able to <strong>produce the labour</strong>.
				Although there was widespread support for <cite class="MONOGRAPH">The CYBRE Manifesto</cite>, <strong>there were no resulting cybre projects</strong>.
				Instead, the fediverse itself seemed to fracture, with people <strong>burning out</strong>, <strong>getting hurt</strong>, <strong>making enemies</strong>, and <strong>largely looking the other way</strong>.
			</p>
			<p>
				<cite class="MONOGRAPH">The CYBRE Manifesto</cite> calls for a <strong>reïmagining of the cybre as a lived space</strong>, inhabited by living people, with <strong>all the precarity and vulnerability which that entails</strong>.
				It <strong>rightfully criticizes corporations and governments</strong> for erasing this quality of the cybre dimension, but increasingly over the past year I have become familiar with the ways in which <strong>we perpetuate this erasure ourselves</strong>.
				I think a <strong>long period of self‐reflection</strong>, <strong>self‐criticism</strong>, and <strong>renewed commitment to growth</strong> is called for in the coming months.
			</p>
			<p>
				Acknowledging precarity and vulnerability means acknowledging that <strong>the people who care for us also need care</strong>, are also human, with flaws and hopes and goals.
				<strong>We are not states feigning invincibility</strong>; we are hurt, we are traumatized, and <strong>we are reminded of these things every day</strong>.
				What we need to do a better job of remembering is <strong>the ways in which <em>others</em> experience hurt and trauma</strong> too; <strong>the lens of vulnerability becomes exploitative</strong> when we are the only people we ever conceive of as vulnerable.
				When we expect others to perfectly accommodate our needs without ever accommodating theirs.
				If we are going to build a solidarity around shared vulnerability, <strong>it is not enough</strong> to simply state, in the abstract, that all people are vulnerable, and then proceed to <strong>only act according to the axes of vulnerability which personally impact ourselves</strong>.
			</p>
			<p>
				And so, on this <time datetime="2018-11-26"><u class="EVENT">CYBREMONDAY 2018</u></time>, I ask that you all <strong>pause to reflect on the ways</strong> in which the vulnerability of those around you is <strong>erased and made invisible</strong> by the structures of cybrespace.
				<cite class="MONOGRAPH">The CYBRE Manifesto</cite> <strong>remains just as relevant now</strong> as it did when it was first published almost ten months ago.
				But <strong>if we are to make progress</strong> on the very difficult tasks which lie before us, it is not sufficient to <strong>merely acknowledge the veracity of its claims</strong>.
				<strong>We need to get better</strong> <b class="HIGHLIGHT">at</b> <strong>finding each other</strong>, <b class="HIGHLIGHT">at</b> <strong>coming together</strong>, <b class="HIGHLIGHT">at</b> <strong>renewing our commitments</strong>, and <b class="HIGHLIGHT">at</b> <strong>doïng the work required</strong> to make a difference on those things which truly matter.
				We need to <strong>look inward at ourselves</strong>, and <strong>look proximally at our communities</strong>, <em>before</em> we go about trying to change the world.

					In <time>1995</time>, during their annuäl <u class="EVENT">Word‐of‐the‐Year</u> vote, the <u class="ORGANIZATION">American Dialect Society</u> announced <i class="MENTION">cyber</i> as one of <a rel="external noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.americandialect.org/woty/all-of-the-words-of-the-year-1990-to-present#1994" title="All of the Words of the Year, 1990 to Present § 1994 Word of the Year | American Dialect Society">the <time>1994</time> words of the year</a>.

			<p>
				For most of my life, the word <i class="MENTION">cyber</i> has seemed largely an anachronism, evoked for a sense of <strong>90s‐era nostalgia</strong>, recalling a time when <u class="BLOC">the Internet</u> and computers were considered <strong>an exciting new world of untold possibilities</strong> rather than an <strong>everpresent, integrated (and often troubling) part</strong> of our day‐to‐day lives.
				In stark contrast are the ways the word has persisted in the common vernacular, through phrases such as <i class="MENTION">cyberwarfare</i>, <i class="MENTION">Cyber Monday</i>, and <i class="MENTION">cyberpunk</i>—signalling <strong>militarism</strong>, <strong>capitalism</strong>, and <strong>dystopia</strong>, respectively; instead of the naïve optimism of the 90s, the <i class="MENTION">cyber</i> of the present‐day connotates <em>all of the fraughtness and danger that our interconnected technological networks have the potential to contain</em>.

				The words do not line up with the facts.
				<strong>Far from a threat to sociëty, these unsavory aspects of <i class="SO-CALLED">cyberspace</i> seem to be part‐and‐parcel with its normal operation and expected functioning.</strong>
				And—at the same time—<strong>other stories are not beïng told</strong>.
				<b class="HIGHLIGHT">The</b> indie <strong>artists and musicians struggling (and, often, <em>succeeding</em>) to find audiënces amidst the massive centralization, appropriation, and commodification of virtuälly every artform.
				<b class="HIGHLIGHT">The</b> networks of <strong>trans folx providing each other with care and support</strong> sorely lacking in sociëty at‐large.
				<b class="HIGHLIGHT">The</b> communities of friends, activists, and lovers</strong>, working together, in their spare time, for little‐to‐no pay, to design and implement systems which will help to liberate them from capitalism's hold.
				<strong>Some of these are not stories so much as sensations.</strong>
				The <strong>warmth of a screen</strong> on a long, darkened road.
				The <strong>buzz of your partner</strong> after an anxious night alone.

			<p>
				<strong>We must consider the consequences of conceiving of the digital landscape as one of pure capitalistic exploitation and military expansion, in which the lives and needs of its inhabitants are supernumerary and inconsequential (except as subscribers, customers, or subjects) to the machinations of power at play.</strong>
				If this is indeed the shape that <i class="SO-CALLED">cyber</i> space takes on today, <strong><em>might we not need a new kind of fraughtness</em></strong>, one which <strong>challenges this social order</strong> and <strong>reässerts the value of life and community</strong> in our day‐to‐day interactions online?
				To put the question another way:
				Is <em>this</em> (capitalism, militarism, exploitation, oppression) all that <q>computers and electronic communication</q> can be?
				Or <strong><em>are there other landscapes imaginable?</em></strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Pursuïng this question is what <dfn id="dfn.cybre_theory">cybre theory</dfn> is all about.
				It is a <strong>queering of conventional <i class="SO-CALLED">cyber</i> discourse</strong> to shed light on the <strong>personal</strong>, the <strong>intimate</strong>, the <strong>community</strong>, the <strong>many and varied bonds</strong> which tie us together through technology outside of pure capitalistic norms.
				<strong>It is also a call to action</strong> against those systems and structures which seek to oppress, control, and ultimately erase these bonds from existence.

				Over the past few years, the landscape has shifted dramatically in terms of how we talk about the internet.
				In one sense, this is to say:
				<strong>We talk about it at all</strong>.
				<u class="COUNTRY">Twitter</u>, <u class="COUNTRY">Facebook</u>, et al receive mainstream treatment in the daily news as questions arise regarding everything from <a rel="external noopener noreferrer" title="Trump's tweets central to legal cases on dossier, travel ban and more | CNNPolitics" href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/12/28/politics/trump-tweets-legal-cases-official-statements/">their use</a> by government officials to <a rel="external noopener noreferrer" title="Facebook, admitting it can be bad for democracy, tries to end voter meddling before midterms | USA Today" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2018/01/22/facebook-tries-wipe-out-election-meddling-before-2018-midterms/1055710001/">their role</a> in the <u class="EVENT"><time>2016</time> <u class="COUNTRY"><abbr title="United States">US</abbr></u> <u class="ROLE">Presidential</u> election</u>; bugs like <a rel="external noopener noreferrer" title="The Heartbleed Bug" href="http://heartbleed.com/"><u class="GENERIC">Heartbleed</u></a> and <a rel="external noopener noreferrer" title="Meltdown and Spectre" href="https://spectreattack.com/"><u class="GENERIC">Spectre</u></a> become issues of international concern; <a rel="external noopener noreferrer" title="Jailed Russian hacker: I hacked Democrats 'under the command' of Russian intelligence agents | Business Insider" href="www.businessinsider.com/russian-hacker-democrats-dnc-intelligence-2017-12">hackers</a> and <a rel="external noopener noreferrer" title="How a Dorm Room Minecraft Scam Brought Down the Internet | WIRED" href="https://www.wired.com/story/mirai-botnet-minecraft-scam-brought-down-the-internet/">botnets</a> and <a rel="external noopener noreferrer" title="The Meme Of The Year | MTV News" href="http://www.mtv.com/news/2962388/the-meme-of-the-year/"><i class="SO-CALLED">those damn emails</i></a> have now dominated political discussions for over a year.
			</p>
			<p>
				Creäted by mass media for an (inter)national audiënce, these stories typically centre on big businesses, large governments, or—occasionally—one or two problematic individuäls who have managed to make something difficult for the aformentioned.
				<strong>Gone are the days</strong> of talking about <em><i class="SO-CALLED">internet communities</i></em> and <em><i class="SO-CALLED">digital uprising</i></em>—acknowledging the <strong>radical transformative potential</strong> of cybre movements like <code class="HASHTAG">#ArabSpring</code> ceased quickly once <code class="HASHTAG">#BlackLivesMatter</code> showed that <strong>it could happen in <u class="COUNTRY">the States</u> too</strong>.
				Instead, internet spaces are construed as <strong>political in the worst way</strong>—a politics of <strong>pure, empty strucutres</strong>, devoid of life and material consequence, <strong>interacting like clockwork</strong> according to the forces of power at play.

				While woefully inaccurate, speaking about the internet as though it were devoid of inhabitants <strong>serves the interests</strong> of <strong>those who seek to exploit it</strong>, ethical concerns—and even personal agency—fading into the distance on such a broad scale.
				As an (to varyïng degrees) open publishing platform, there is nothing which can be done to <em>directly</em> inhibit the <strong>publishing of counternarratives</strong> or the recognition of individual or collective life, voice, and agency online.
				However, <strong>these things can be easily dismissed</strong> so long as they can be classified as <i class="SO-CALLED">offtopic</i> or <i class="SO-CALLED">irrelevant</i>—and in an age where the <i class="SO-CALLED">relevance</i> of knowledge is <strong>largely determined by corporate algorithms</strong> (à la <u class="ORGANIZATION">Bing</u>, <u class="ORGANIZATION">Twitter</u>, <u class="ORGANIZATION">Facebook</u>, <u class="ORGANIZATION">Google</u>), this is no small matter.
				In an internet which overflows with <em>information</em>, we have <strong>given up the means</strong> of producing our own <em>knowledge</em>—and it is <strong>well past time</strong> to take those back.
			</p>
			<p>
				Consequently, it is imperative that we not only concentrate our efforts on the <em>publishing</em> of cybre narratives, but that we also <strong>repeatedly and unrelentingly affirm these narratives as important, topical, and meaningful</strong>, at least as much as those being published on a grander scale.
				<strong>As content which runs counter to the normative gaze of <i class="SO-CALLED">relevance</i></strong>, such stories will <em>by definition</em> be <strong>difficult to discover through <em>conventional</em> means</strong>—and, in many ways, this is desirable.
				But it means that <strong>we must develop a practice of actively promoting, sharing in, and involving ourselves, on the community level, with these conversations</strong>, and create <em>other</em> passages through which they might be seen or heard.
			</p>
			<p>
				The goal here is not to push radical narratives into the mainstream discourse so much as it is to <strong>decentre the mainstream discourse as the be‐all and end‐all of what matters to us, our loved ones, and our communities</strong>.
				The (inter)national politick will always be of concern to the people, but this does not imply that the people should be solely concerned with the (inter)national politick.
				Cybre shops local.
				And so it goes.

				<strong>I was only 14</strong> when <u class="ORGANIZATION">Yahoo</u> <a rel="external noopener noreferrer" title="Yahoo Quietly Pulls The Plug On Geocities | TechCrunch" href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/04/23/yahoo-quietly-pulls-the-plug-on-geocities/">announced</a> that <strong><u class="COUNTRY">GeoCities</u> in the <u class="COUNTRY">United States</u> would be shut down</strong>—as my internet history at the time consisted almost entirely of <u class="COUNTRY">RuneScape</u> and <u class="SETTLEMENT">Wikipedia</u>, it's safe to say that the event hardly registered on my radar.
				I didn't even really learn what <u class="COUNTRY">GeoCities</u> <em>was</em> until much later, through websites like <a rel="external noopener noreferrer" href="http://oneterabyteofkilobyteage.tumblr.com/"><i class="SERIES">One Terabyte of Kilobyte Age Photo Op</i></a> and browsing the collection in <a rel="external noopener noreferrer" href="https://archive.org/web/geocities.php"><cite class="SERIES">the Internet Archive</cite></a>.
				This discovery came roughly synonymously with my decision to switch to a <u class="ORGANIZATION">Gender Studies</u> major, and so naturally I found myself <strong>wandering the streets of <u class="SETTLEMENT">WestHollywood</u></strong>, browsing the homepages of an <abbr title="Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender">LGBT</abbr> community of years gone by.
			</p>
			<p>
				Some of what I discovered there, I had <strong>expected to find</strong>:
				<b class="HIGHLIGHT">The</b> <strong>homewrought, old‐fashioned look and feel</strong> of the pages; <b class="HIGHLIGHT">the</b> <strong>inconsistent</strong> (often within the same page) <strong>rhetoric and terminology</strong>; <b class="HIGHLIGHT">the</b> <strong>frequent fetishization and sexuälization</strong> of queer—especially trans—bodies; <b class="HIGHLIGHT">the</b> <strong>stories of struggle and queer oppression</strong>; <b class="HIGHLIGHT">the</b> <strong>vibrant—if somewhat under‐the‐surface—community</strong>, using the tools they had available to persist through it all.
				Other things, perhaps betraying my naïveté, <strong>caught me completely by surprise</strong>; for example, the <strong>long, legalistic introductory pages</strong> which demanded that visitors be a legal adult before even <em>beginning</em> to look at information on being trans or gay.

				From a cursory glance at these websites, it seems the fight for cybre queer representation has <strong>already been won</strong>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Under the surface, though, things are much the same.

				<strong>And there are newer problems as well.</strong>
				<b class="HIGHLIGHT">The</b> ever‐increasing focus on a <strong>white and/or privileged</strong> gay experience; <b class="HIGHLIGHT">the</b> <strong>emphasis on allies</strong> and <i class="SO-CALLED">showing support</i> over providing material help or change; <b class="HIGHLIGHT">the</b> <strong>appropriation of queer narratives and trauma</strong> for clickbait income.
			</p>
			<p>
				In fact, despite appearances, when it comes to <strong>connecting people with resources</strong> or <strong>accurately reflecting the queer experiënce</strong> online, <strong><em>things might be worse than ever</em></strong>.
				The steady encroachment on personal and nonprofit websites by <u class="ORGANIZATION">Google</u>, <u class="ORGANIZATION">Facebook</u>, and <u class="ORGANIZATION">Amazon</u>—as well as the postweb internet of <u class="PERSON">Alexa</u> and <u class="PERSON">Siri</u>—have restricted both the <strong>amount of information available</strong> and the <strong>kind of community structures allowed</strong> to only that which those providers see fit to approve or design for.
				As one particularly drastic example: The <u class="ORGANIZATION">International Foundation for Gender Education</u> website <strong><a rel="external noopener noreferrer" title="The International Foundation for Gender Education &amp; Transgender Tapestry | Internet Archive Wayback Machine" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20091104053637/http://www.ifge.org/">was once</a> one of the best resources on the web</strong> for trans information—<strong>now it is little more than a <a rel="external noopener noreferrer" title="The International Foundation for Gender Education" href="http://www.ifge.org/">poorly‐formatted blog</a></strong>.
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>IFGE has offered a Web site containing information for transgender people since 1998.

				Placing gay cybre culture in the hands of companies whose workforces are primarily straight, white, and male <strong>simply doesn't make sense</strong>.
				Consequently, we must <strong>reclaim and reposition cybre pride</strong> as something which is created under our own authorship, within our own communities.
				<strong>It is not enough</strong> to merely denounce corporations' gesutres towards <abbr title="Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender">LGBT</abbr> acceptance as hypocritical—we must <strong>provide a counternarrative</strong> which <strong>demonstrates and reäffirms queer pride and community</strong>—in all its forms and complexity, outside the boundaries of what is normative or deemed acceptable in the public sphere.
			</p>
			<p>
				This means <strong>doïng more than just protest</strong> (although, by all means, continue to protest).
				It means <strong>finding reason to celebrate</strong> and <strong>making queer culture our own</strong>.

				<span>The Message is not the Message;<br />or, Virality is not the Cure</span>
			</h3>
			<p>
				<strong>It is easy</strong>, when considering and discussing the fraught nature of modern cybrespace—perhaps, when faced with a <cite class="MONOGRAPH">Manifesto</cite>—to think that <strong>the message of cybre <em>is</em> its message</strong>; that the message is self‐justifying, so to speak, and the purpose of cybre discourse is to promote cybre discourse and <strong>not some higher aspiration or aim</strong>.
				Given this, <strong>virality seems the obvious tack to take</strong>, spreading and sharing content among friends and peers and social networks, arguïng points and jumping into mentions and doing all of the work that propagating a message entails.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>This impression is deceiving, and it is wrong.</strong>
				The message of cybre—the <strong>imagining of a new digital landscape</strong> which respects <strong>life</strong>, <strong>community</strong>, and <strong>our many and varied relationships of support</strong>, in <strong>all their diverse complexity</strong>—is <strong>not something which can be spread</strong> via discourse or social media post, but through <strong>decades of work</strong> to develop the structures <strong>from which these forms might evolve</strong>.
				Indeed, <strong>insofar as it diverts queer energies</strong> <strong>away from making progress</strong> and <strong>into defending positions</strong>, and <strong>insofar as it centralizes discussion</strong> inside the normative structures <strong>whose dismantling is our ultimate aim</strong>, <strong>discourse is our opponent</strong> in this journey forward.

				<p>We need fewer well-intentioned essays addressed to bros with good intentions about why sexist language might seem good but is bad. In the tech feminism community, we’ve been writing these essays for most of a decade. The <em>systematic</em> use of abuser tactics to control conversations and shut down criticism continues. These conversations go on and on, and happen over and over, each one seemingly unencumbered by the lessons of the previous one — <em>what’s happening isn’t a conversation at all, but rather, a power struggle</em>.</p>

				<strong>Far from a quick path to success</strong>, virality has proven itself over the past few years to be a <strong>source of violence and harrassment</strong> in exchange for <strong>little or no material gain</strong>.
				Almost by definition, in order to reach a viral state, a message must first be <strong>reduced and reformatted</strong> into something which is <strong>palatable to the mainstream</strong>.
				In doïng so, the <strong>fundamental urgency and nuänce</strong> of the original is invariably lost.
				<strong>Viral moments are ephemeral</strong>, burning quickly and then vanishing as the next takes centrestage.
				But <strong>the cybre project is persistent, ongoing, continuäl</strong>, reaching back to the very first days of networked connectivity and forward into futures unknown.

				In some ways, the project of discourse is <strong>doomed from the start</strong>.
				<strong>How to describe</strong> the <strong>feelings of hurt and precariöusness</strong> which accompany everyday life for marginalized queers in the modern connected world?
				<strong>How to explain</strong> that <em>these are <strong>not just numbers</strong> for us</em> (<b class="HIGHLIGHT">40%</b> of trans respondents attempting suïcide at some time in their lives, <b class="HIGHLIGHT">30%</b> experiëncing homelessness, <b class="HIGHLIGHT">47%</b> being victims of sexuäl assault, <b class="HIGHLIGHT">10%</b> in the last year, <b class="HIGHLIGHT">13%</b> while in K–12, <b class="HIGHLIGHT">58%</b> reporting harrassment by police in the past year alone, <b class="HIGHLIGHT">30%</b> facing mistreatment in the workplace, <b class="HIGHLIGHT">15%</b> now facing unemployment, <b class="HIGHLIGHT">29%</b> living in poverty, and all of these numbers increasing dramatically when componded with other forms of marginalization—according to <a rel="external noopener noreferrer" title="USTS Reports | 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey" href="http://www.ustranssurvey.org/reports">the <cite class="MONOGRAPH">2015 U.S. Transgender Survey</cite></a>), but <strong>our lived experiënces</strong>, and those of <strong>our friends</strong>, <strong>our lovers</strong>, <strong>our families</strong>, and <strong>our communities</strong>?
				<strong>How to argue and debate</strong> over the <strong>fundamental value of a life</strong>, its <strong>right to exist</strong> in a space, its <strong>right to the resources and support</strong> that it needs to survive and to flourish, despite whatever forces might seek to oppress and control?
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>There are no words, and there never will be.</strong>
				And so <strong>our goal must be something more</strong> than merely <em>seeking understanding</em> or <em>spreading a message</em>.
				It must be to <strong>assert value</strong>, <strong>change the landscape</strong>, <strong>press ever forward</strong> into this cybre realm.
				It must be to <strong>embrace the fraughtness at hand</strong>, <strong>turn it into something meaningful</strong>, <strong>undo the structures which constrain us</strong> and support each other into tomorrow and beyond.
				<strong><em>This is the cybre mission.</em></strong>
				Together onward.

				At the end of last year, <u class="ORGANIZATION">PANTONE</u> announced <u class="GENERIC">PANTONE 18-3838 Ultra Violet</u> as their <i class="SO-CALLED">Color of the Year</i>.
				<u class="ORGANIZATION">PANTONE</u> has a long history of <a rel="external noopener noreferrer" title="The Propoganda of Pantone: Colour and Subcultural Sublimation | LOKI" href="https://www.lokidesign.net/journal/2016/2/22/the-propaganda-of-pantone-colour-and-subcultural-sublimation">sublimating subcultural aesthetic</a> as a way of defanging activist design for the mass market.
				As the <a rel="external noopener noreferrer" title="Pantone Color of the Year 2018 – 18-3838 Ultra Violet | PANTONE" href="https://www.pantone.com/color-of-the-year-2018">official press release</a> states:
				<q>Musical icons Prince, David Bowie, and Jimi Hendrix brought shades of Ultra Violet to the forefront of western pop culture as personal expressions of individuality. Nuanced and full of emotion, the depth of PANTONE 18-3838 Ultra Violet symbolizes experimentation and non-conformity, spurring individuals to imagine their unique mark on the world, and push boundaries through creative outlets.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				Taking a colour associated with (in their own words) nonconformity and (let's face it) queerness and using it to market capitalistic mass‐produced product is downright nefarious and as a friend of the colour purple I say let's not let them get away with it.
				<code class="DARK COLOUR" style="Background-Color: #9900FF">#9900FF</code> is a websafe purple of roughly the same hue as <u class="GENERIC">Ultra Violet</u> but with a little added vim and vigour.
				It's the kind of colour that has only ever existed on the personal web, and which, even in an age of viral vaporwave marketing, any respectable capitalist organization would think twice before using in any official publication.
			</p>
			<p>
				Let's keep it that way lol.
				Go wild.
